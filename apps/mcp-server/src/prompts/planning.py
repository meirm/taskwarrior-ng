## Task Description Format

### Structure Template
```
# [Descriptive Title]

## Context/Background
Brief explanation of why this task is needed or the problem it solves.

## Objectives
- Clear, actionable goal 1
- Clear, actionable goal 2
- Specific outcome or deliverable

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific requirement 1
- [ ] Specific requirement 2
- [ ] Definition of "done"

## Notes
- Any additional details
- Dependencies or prerequisites
- Resources or links
```

### Examples

#### Before (poor):
"Fix the bug"

#### After (good):
```
# Fix Login Authentication Timeout Bug

## Context/Background
Users are experiencing timeout errors during login attempts, particularly during peak hours.

## Objectives
- Identify root cause of authentication timeouts
- Implement fix to prevent timeout errors
- Ensure login process is reliable under load

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bug reproduced and root cause identified
- [ ] Fix implemented and tested
- [ ] Login success rate > 99% during peak hours
- [ ] No regression in login performance

## Notes
- Affects approximately 15% of users during 9-11 AM
- Check database connection pooling
- May need to optimize authentication query
```

### Guidelines
1. **Start with a descriptive title** that clearly indicates what needs to be done
2. **Provide context** so anyone can understand why this task matters
3. **Define clear objectives** that are specific and measurable
4. **Use checkboxes** for acceptance criteria to track progress
5. **Include relevant details** in notes section
6. **Keep it concise** but comprehensive enough to be actionable

When I provide a task description, please reformat it using this structure, expanding on the details where necessary to make it clear, actionable, and well-organized."""
