# Product Mission

## Pitch

TaskWarrior-NG is a modern full-stack web application that bridges the gap between TaskWarrior's powerful command-line functionality and modern UI/UX expectations, providing productivity-focused users with an intuitive interface while enabling seamless AI agent integration for next-generation task management workflows.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Developer Power Users**: Developers and technical professionals who rely on TaskWarrior CLI but need visual task management for complex projects
- **Productivity Enthusiasts**: Knowledge workers seeking advanced task management features with modern UI and AI integration capabilities
- **AI-Enhanced Teams**: Teams leveraging AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT) for task automation and workflow optimization

### User Personas

**Alex Chen** (28-40 years old)
- **Role:** Senior Software Engineer / Tech Lead
- **Context:** Manages multiple projects, uses TaskWarrior CLI daily, values keyboard shortcuts and efficiency
- **Pain Points:** TaskWarrior CLI lacks visual overview, difficult to share progress with team, no mobile access
- **Goals:** Maintain CLI power while gaining visual insights, integrate with team workflows, access tasks on mobile

**Jordan Martinez** (25-35 years old)
- **Role:** Product Manager / Project Coordinator
- **Context:** Coordinates development teams, needs visual dashboards, prefers web interfaces over CLI
- **Pain Points:** TaskWarrior CLI too technical, needs team visibility, lacks analytics and reporting
- **Goals:** Visual task tracking, team collaboration features, progress reporting and analytics

**Sam Taylor** (30-45 years old)
- **Role:** AI-Enhanced Knowledge Worker / Consultant
- **Context:** Uses AI agents extensively, needs automation, values AI-human collaborative workflows
- **Pain Points:** Manual task entry, no AI integration with existing tools, fragmented workflow between tools
- **Goals:** Seamless AI agent integration, automated task creation from conversations, intelligent task prioritization

## The Problem

### Powerful CLI, Poor UX

TaskWarrior's command-line interface is incredibly powerful but lacks modern user experience expectations. Users struggle with visual task organization, lack mobile access, and find it difficult to share progress with teams. This creates a 40% productivity gap for users who need both power and usability.

**Our Solution:** Preserve TaskWarrior's power while providing a beautiful, responsive web interface with real-time analytics.

### Fragmented AI Workflows

Modern productivity users leverage AI agents for task management, but existing tools don't integrate seamlessly with AI workflows. Users manually copy-paste between AI conversations and task managers, losing 2-3 hours per week on workflow friction.

**Our Solution:** Native MCP protocol integration enabling AI agents to directly manage tasks through natural language.

### Limited Collaboration Features

TaskWarrior excels for individual use but lacks team collaboration features that modern work requires. Teams using TaskWarrior struggle to share progress, coordinate efforts, and maintain visibility across projects.

**Our Solution:** Web-based interface with shared project views while preserving individual TaskWarrior database integrity.

## Differentiators

### Native TaskWarrior Integration

Unlike web-based task managers that require migration, TaskWarrior-NG works directly with existing TaskWarrior installations and databases. This preserves years of task history, custom configurations, and CLI workflows while adding modern UI capabilities.

### AI-First Architecture

Unlike traditional task managers with bolt-on AI features, TaskWarrior-NG is built from the ground up for AI integration using the Model Context Protocol. AI agents can manage tasks naturally through conversation, creating seamless human-AI collaborative workflows.

### Power User Focus

Unlike simplified task apps, TaskWarrior-NG preserves TaskWarrior's advanced features (complex filtering, custom attributes, dependency tracking) while making them accessible through modern UI patterns. This serves power users who need sophisticated task management capabilities.
