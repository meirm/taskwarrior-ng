> Spec: Project Selector UI Component
> Created: 2025-09-02
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement an advanced project selector component in the web interface that allows users to select from existing projects or create new ones directly when adding or editing tasks. This feature will streamline task organization and eliminate the need to pre-create projects before task assignment.

## User Stories

### Task Creation with Project Assignment

As a user creating a new task, I want to select a project from existing ones or create a new project on-the-fly, so that I can organize my tasks efficiently without interrupting my workflow.

When creating a task, I open the task creation form and see a project selector field. The field shows a dropdown with all existing projects. If my desired project doesn't exist, I can type a new project name directly in the field, and it will be created automatically when I save the task. The interface provides autocomplete suggestions as I type, helping me avoid creating duplicate projects with similar names.

### Task Editing with Project Change

As a user editing an existing task, I want to change its project assignment or move it to a newly created project, so that I can reorganize my tasks as my work structure evolves.

When editing a task, I can click on the project field to see all available projects. I can select a different existing project, clear the project assignment entirely, or type a new project name to create and assign in one action. The UI clearly indicates whether I'm selecting an existing project or creating a new one.

## Spec Scope

1. **Advanced Project Selector Component** - A searchable dropdown component that displays existing projects and allows inline creation of new ones
2. **Task Creation Form Integration** - Integration of the project selector into the new task creation form with proper validation and state management
3. **Task Edit Form Integration** - Integration of the project selector into the task edit form with support for changing or removing project assignments
4. **Project Autocomplete** - Type-ahead functionality that suggests existing projects as users type, with clear indication of "create new" option
5. **Hierarchical Project Support** - Support for dot-notation hierarchical projects (e.g., "Work.Backend.API") with proper parsing and display

## Out of Scope

- Dedicated project management page or view
- Project renaming functionality
- Project deletion or archiving features
- Project-level settings or metadata
- Bulk project operations
- Project templates or presets

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can select projects from a searchable dropdown when creating or editing tasks in the web interface
2. Users can type new project names directly in the selector and have them created automatically upon task save
3. The component provides visual feedback distinguishing between selecting existing projects and creating new ones
